# About Me
My name is Fengbin Tu. I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My dissertation's title is **High Energy-efficient Neural Network Accelerator Design**, advised by Prof. Shaojun Wei and Prof. Shouyi Yin. 

A reconfigurable multi-modal neural network processor (Thinker) has been designed based on my [DNA](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7898402/) architecture. The Thinker chip was exhibited at the [2016 National Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week](http://news.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thunews/9648/2016/20161013102253491194453/20161013102253491194453_.html), as a representative work from Tsinghua University. The Thinker chip was highly praised by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, and featured by [Yang Lan One on One](http://www.iqiyi.com/v_19rr77vmeo.html?wx_uid1=wxidoG0a9jsItpryB9soI-lGgUuUtvlc&wx_uid2=wxidoG0a9jsItpryB9soI-lGgUuUtvlc) and [AI Tech Talk](https://www.leiphone.com/news/201705/8sB0WHz6D70J7NAy.html). It won the [ISLPED'17 Design Contest Award](http://islped.org/2017/index.php), which was [the first time for a Chinese Mainland team to win the award](http://news.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thunews/10303/2017/20170809193415062503521/20170809193415062503521_.html).

This is an exciting field where fresh ideas come out every day, so I'm maintaining a project named [Neural Networks on Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon), to collect works that interest me and make comments on them.

# Project Experience
Feb. 2017 - Present: **DNA II**

* I'm designing the 2nd generation of DNA (DNA II) to enable ultra low-power computing of deep neural networks. Optimization techniques from the hardware level to the software level are used.

Jan. 2016 - Present: [**Neural Networks on Silicon**](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon)

* I'm collecting works on neural network accelerators and related topics, in a GitHub project named [Neural Networks on Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon). It has attracted many researchers all around the world.

Sep. 2015 - Oct. 2016: **DNA**

* I have designed a deep convolutional neural network accelerator (DNA) targeting flexible and efficient CNN acceleration. 
  - This is the first work to assign Input/Output/Weight Reuse to different layers of a CNN, which optimizes system-level energy consumption based on different CONV parameters.
  - A 4-level CONV engine is designed to to support different tiling parameters for higher resource utilization and performance.
  - A layer-based scheduling framework is proposed to optimize both system-level energy efficiency and performance.
* A reconfigurable multi-modal neural network processor (Thinker) has been designed based on the DNA architecture.

Mar. 2015 - Dec. 2016: **Image/Video Encoder Based on RNA**

* I have designed an image/video encoding system based on my previous design RNA. The system can online switch to an image encoder or video encoder, by reconfiguring the processing core RNA.

Oct. 2013 - Oct. 2014: **RNA**

* I have designed a reconfigurable neural accelerator (RNA) that can be configured for different neural networks. RNA is targeted for approximate computing in multiple application domains.
