# About Me
My name is Fengbin Tu. I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My dissertation's title is high energy-efficient neural network accelerator design, advised by Prof. Shaojun Wei and Dr. Shouyi Yin. This is an exciting field where fresh ideas come out every day, so I build a project named [Neural Networks on Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon), to collect works that interest me and make comments on them.

# Research Interests
Computer Architecture, Deep Learning, VLSI Design, Approximate Computing

# Education
Sep. 2013 - Present: **Tsinghua University (THU)**

* GPA 3.8/4.0, Rank 2/19 in the Institute of Microelectronics
* Ph.D. Candidate of Electronic Science and Technology

Sep. 2009 - Jun. 2013: **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**

* GPA 3.9/4.0, Rank 1/255 in the School of Electronic Engineering
* Bachelor of Electronic Science and Technology 

# Project Experience
Feb. 2017 - Present: **DNA II**

* I'm designing the 2nd generation of DNA (DNA II) to enable ultra low-power computing of deep neural networks.

Jan. 2016 - Present: [**Neural Networks on Silicon**](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon)

* I'm collecting works on neural network accelerators and related topics, in a GitHub project named [Neural Networks on Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon). It has attracted many researchers all around the world.

Sep. 2015 - Oct. 2016: **DNA**

* I designed a deep convolutional neural network accelerator (DNA) targeting flexible and efficient convolution acceleration. DNA can support various convolution parameters while maintaining high energy efficiency in different cases.

Mar. 2015 - Present: **Image/Video Encoder Based on RNA**

* I'm designing an image/video encoding system based on my previous design RNA. The system can online switch to an image encoder or video encoder, by reconfiguring the processing core RNA.

Oct. 2013 - Oct. 2014: **RNA**

* I designed a reconfigurable neural accelerator (RNA) that can be configured for different neural networks. RNA is targeted for approximate computing in multiple application domains.
