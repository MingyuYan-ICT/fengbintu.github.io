  "body": "# About Me\r\nMy name is Fengbin Tu. I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My dissertation title is high energy-efficient neural network accelerator design, advised by Prof. Shaojun Wei and Dr. Shouyi Yin. This is an exciting field where fresh ideas come out every day, so I build a project called [Neural Networks on Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon), to collect works that interest me and make comments on them.\r\n\r\n# Research Interests\r\nComputer Architecture, Deep Learning, VLSI Design, Approximate Computing\r\n\r\n# Education\r\nSep. 2013 - Present: **Tsinghua University (THU)**\r\n* GPA 3.9/4.0, Rank 2/19 in the Institute of Microelectronics\r\n* Ph.D. Candidate of Electronic Science and Technology\r\n\r\nSep. 2009 - Jun. 2013: **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**\r\n* GPA 3.9/4.0, Rank 1/255 in the School of Electronic Engineering\r\n* Bachelor of Electronic Science and Technology \r\n\r\n# Experience\r\nSep. 2015 - Present: **DNA**\r\n* I design a deep convolutional neural network accelerator (DNA) targeting flexible and efficient convolution acceleration. DNA can support various convolution parameters while maintaining high power efficiency in different cases.\r\n\r\nMar. 2015 - Present: **Image/Video Encoder Based on RNA**\r\n* I design an image/video encoding system based on my previous design RNA. The system can online switch to an image encoder or video encoder, by reconfiguring the processing core RNA.\r\n\r\nOct. 2013 - Oct. 2014: **RNA**\r\n* I design a reconfigurable neural accelerator (RNA) that can be configured for different neural networks. RNA is targeted for approximate computing in multiple application domains.\r\n\r\n# Honors and Awards\r\n* Outstanding Student Scholarship (2016)\r\n* Lam Research Scholarship (2015)\r\n* Outstanding Paper Award at THU Ph.D. Student Forum (2015)\r\n* National Scholarship for Undergraduate (2010, 2011, 2012)\r\n* Merit Student of BUPT (2010, 2011, 2012) \r\n\r\n# Selected Publications\r\nConference Papers\r\n* **F. Tu**, S. Yin, P. Ouyang, S. Tang, L. Liu, S. Wei, Presentation at the 2017 ISSCC Student Research Preview Session (ISSCC-SRP), San Francisco, USA. (_To Appear_)\r\n* **F. Tu**, S. Yin, P. Ouyang, L. Liu, S. Wei, ``RNA: A Reconfigurable Architecture for Hardware Neural Acceleration,\" Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE), Grenoble, France, 2015. (**Acceptance Rate: 22%**)\r\n* **F. Tu**, S. Yin, P. Ouyang, L. Liu, S. Wei, ``Neural Approximating Architecture  Targeting Multiple Application Domains,\" IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), Lisbon, Portugal, 2015.\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\nAddress: Room 3-330, FIT Building, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, P.R.
